# Dynamic Knowledge Corpus Research Assistant

This repository contains the implementation plan for a comprehensive Dynamic Knowledge Corpus Research Assistant system.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into logical folders based on functionality:

- **core_architecture/**: System overview and key features
- **data_processing/**: Document processing and vector search
- **intelligence_layer/**: Research agents, orchestration, LLM services
- **memory_context/**: Memory and knowledge context management
- **interfaces/**: Web interface and response generation
- **advanced_features/**: Enhanced agent features and parameter optimization
- **system_infrastructure/**: System integration and resource monitoring
- **data/**: Combined directory for both input documents and output data

## Environment Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Add your API keys to the `.env` file
3. Never commit your `.env` file with actual API keys

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your actual API keys
```

## Usage

The system is designed to:
1. Read documents from the `data/` directory (configured as INPUT_FOLDER)
2. Process them into multi-level chunks with rich metadata
3. Store embeddings in a vector database in the same `data/` directory (configured as OUTPUT_FOLDER)
4. Provide an intelligent research assistant interface

See the implementation map (`00_IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md`) for details on each component.
