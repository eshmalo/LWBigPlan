2. Core Components and Responsibilities
A. Orchestrator

Central coordination of all system components
Query analysis and execution strategy determination
Dynamic parameter adjustment based on query type and system state
Conversation flow management and context tracking

B. Intelligence Layer

Research Agent: Multi-step information discovery and knowledge retrieval
Parameter Optimizer: Dynamic adjustment of search and processing parameters
Document Analyzer: Content-aware metadata extraction and classification
Response Generator: Converting research findings into coherent answers

C. Knowledge Base

Vector Database: Similarity search for relevant information
Document Processing Pipeline: Converting raw documents to searchable chunks
Metadata System: Rich classification of documents and chunks
Multi-level Chunk Storage: Hierarchical representation of content

D. Memory System

Conversation History: Tracking user interactions
Knowledge Context: Managing active information relevant to current queries
Notes Repository: System observations about documents and queries
Performance Metrics: Tracking system behavior for optimization

E. User Interface

Chat Interface: Conversational access to the system
Admin Dashboard: System monitoring and control
Feedback Mechanisms: Learning from user interactions
