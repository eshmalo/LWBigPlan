15. Key Features and Advantages
15.1 Dynamic Parameter Adjustment

All search and processing parameters are determined at runtime by LLMs
Parameters adapt to query type, complexity, and system state
No hardcoded thresholds or strategies

15.2 Content-Aware Document Processing

Document analysis extracts rich metadata including structure and content type
Chunk boundaries respect natural document structure
LLM-enhanced chunk metadata captures semantic information

15.3 Advanced Research Capabilities

Multi-iteration progressive search for complex queries
Strategy selection based on query type and complexity
Gap analysis to identify missing information
Automatic query reformulation to fill information gaps

15.4 Sophisticated Context Management

Dynamic allocation of context window between knowledge and conversation
Relevance-based pruning of knowledge context
Conversation compression with summary generation
Context integration for follow-up questions

15.5 Resource Optimization

Adaptive batch sizing based on system load
Parallel processing with dynamic worker allocation
Rate limit awareness for API calls
Model fallback when approaching limits

15.6 Explainable AI Through Notes

LLM components leave explanatory notes about decisions
Complete research path tracking
Parameter adjustment history
Information sufficiency assessments

This comprehensive system provides a flexible and powerful foundation for building knowledge corpus research assistants that can work with any type of content, from academic literature to technical documentation, legal texts, or domain-specific knowledge bases.
